# HANDOVER — Ma'aden MRO Intelligence POC

**Read this first.** Living status board, updated every session. Not a log — history lives
in git and `DECISIONS.md`.

## What this project is

Response to Ma'aden SOW `MD-404-1000-OE-DG-SOW-0000_` Rev 0.0, **Use Case 01 — AI-Powered
Inventory Intelligence & MRO Optimization**. A proof of concept on synthetic data.

**Scope was fixed on 2026-09-10 to three claims and nothing else** — see
[`IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md), which is now the authority on what
gets built:

1. We can find data problems, measured against a sealed answer key.
2. We can set better stock levels than the plant's min/max, measured by backtest.
3. A planner can ask a question in English and get a checkable answer.

If a piece of work does not serve one of those three, it is out of scope. Explicitly
**not being built**: LightGBM, embedding-based matching, Arabic, login, SAP connection,
purchase orders, or any screen beyond the dashboard and the item view.

## Status — 2026-09-10

**Phase 0 approved. Phase 1 (POC) in progress — vertical slice runs end to end at
both presets, and the dataset now survives review.**

Run it:

```
python cli.py all --preset toy      # build + engine + scoreboard   (~1s)
python cli.py all --preset full     # 20k materials                 (~33s)
python -m pytest -q                 # 72 tests
python -m ruff check .
```

Stages are separate on purpose: `build` writes the dataset and answer key, `run`
executes the engine and never touches `answer_key_dir`, `score` grades what `run`
produced. `--data-dir` redirects everything, which is how the CLI smoke test works.

| Step | State |
|---|---|
| `contracts/` schemas + config | Done. Cutoff date, cost model and dead-money rule live here |
| `sim/` replenishment | Done. Vectorised across items, stochastic lead time, shared by generator and scoring |
| 1 · generator + answer key | **Done, both presets.** Typed equipment, positions, shutdown overlay, real work orders |
| 2 · data quality (cap 4) | **Done — all 7 checks + matcher.** 99% recall, 99% precision at full |
| 3 · classifier (ADI × CV²) | Not started — train slice only, scored against `PROFILE_TO_SBC_CLASS` |
| 4 · forecast (Croston family) | Not started — **no LightGBM**; MASE per class vs naive and zero |
| 5 · levels + backtest | Not started — **headline number two** |
| 6a · dead money | Not started — scorer stubbed; engine figure goes beside truth on the dashboard |
| Screens | Dashboard done (one screen). Item view not started. Vendor the JS before any demo |
| 8 · chat, thin | Not started — four tools, twenty golden questions |
| 6b · transfers, slider, work queue | **Only if everything above is green** |

**Current score, full preset** — every planted defect type now has a check:

| Check | Planted | Found | Missed | False | Recall | Precision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BLANK_MPN | 262 | 262 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 100% |
| BLANK_UOM | 60 | 60 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 100% |
| DUPLICATE_MATERIAL | 140 | 134 | 6 | 19 | **96%** | **88%** |
| IMPOSSIBLE_LEAD_TIME | 60 | 60 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 100% |
| ISSUE_WITHOUT_WORK_ORDER | 594 | 594 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 100% |
| NEGATIVE_STOCK | 100 | 100 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 100% |
| UOM_MISMATCH | 80 | 69 | 11 | 0 | 86% | 100% |
| **Total** | **1,296** | **1,279** | **17** | **19** | **99%** | **99%** |

LEDGER_MISMATCH raises 100 informational findings, excluded from precision.

Two known limits, both measured rather than assumed:
- **UOM_MISMATCH** catches an item swapped into a *rare* unit, never one swapped
  into its group's dominant unit — all 11 misses are that shape.
- **Duplicates** lose most to `token_dropped` (72%): when the size is simply left
  off the re-keyed record there is little left to match on. `token_front` and
  `abbrev` are at 98-100%.

### Dataset properties — all asserted in tests, all measured by `scoring/dataset_report.py`

The report is the single place these are computed, so the console and the test
suite cannot disagree about what "in band" means.

| Property | Toy | Full | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lines idle >24 months | 36% | 38% | 30–50% |
| Stock value dead | 30% | 28% | 20–40% |
| Shutdown issue-rate multiple | 3.9× | 3.5× | ≥3× baseline |
| Issues per work order | 2.3 | 2.7 | ≥2 |
| Planned WOs raised in advance | 100%, 37d median | 100%, 38d | 100% |
| Unexplained ledger mismatches | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Unplanted negative balances | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Materials in >1 storeroom | 18% | 17% | ≥10% |

Idle share, dead money, overstock, obsolescence and stockouts are all **emergent**
— they come from the stale min/max policy running against drifting demand and from
equipment being decommissioned mid-history. Only *data* defects are planted.

> The toy preset's dead-value share is noisy: at 300 materials it is dominated by a
> handful of expensive rows, so it moves several points on any RNG reshuffle. It is
> in band, but do not treat small movements there as signal — check `--preset full`,
> where 20k materials average it out.

## Next

1. Remaining six rule checks in `engine/quality.py`, scoring after each one.
2. Duplicate matcher — TF-IDF candidates + RapidFuzz scoring. No embeddings
   (see `DECISIONS.md`); the interface takes a list of scorers so they can be added.
   Note the matcher must handle split history: half the planted duplicates carry
   20–60% of the original's issues.
3. One dashboard screen, to close the vertical slice.
4. Then deepen step by step: classifier → forecasters → policy → dead money.

## Things to avoid

- **Never let `engine/` import `sim/`, `generator/` or `scoring/`.** A test parses
  the AST and fails if it does. If the engine could see the answer key, the score
  would be meaningless and nobody would notice until a Ma'aden engineer asked how
  it was measured.
- **Do not plant overstock, obsolescence or critical-below-reorder.** They must
  emerge from the stale policy and from equipment decommissioning, and are scored
  against `truth`. Planting them would grade the engine on our own injection rules.
- **Never write `stock.on_hand` by hand.** It is recomputed from the movement
  ledger, and negatives are planted last. Any balance not backed by movements shows
  up as a LEDGER_MISMATCH the engine is right to flag and we were wrong to create.
- **Never mix per-day and per-event costs in the newsvendor fractile.** That bug
  pinned every service level to the cap and silently disabled the whole idea.
- **`shortage_cost_per_unit` is defined once**, in `CostModel`. It feeds the
  service level, the SAR work-queue ranking and dead-money valuation. Three
  different versions is how a demo contradicts itself on stage.
- **Do not report "value idle for 24 months" as dead money.** That is 90% of stock
  value and it is wrong: insurance spares correctly sit still for years.
- **Fit on `cfg.train_slice()`, score on `cfg.eval_slice()`.** Never touch the
  movements frame directly for either.
- **Do not apply `z · σ · √LT` across the board** — wrong for the insurance-spare
  population, which is where the expensive errors are.
- **Do not let the LLM compute anything.** It calls the engine and narrates.
- **Do not quote the "50–60% of MRO is SLOB" benchmark.** No traceable source.
- **`noah-stock-v2` / `noah-stock-ui-v2` are reference only** — a prior project.
